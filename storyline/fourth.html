                    Then the bear ran to the painter and said,

                    "I don't like the color of my feet, paint them white for me".

                    The painter was afraid of the bear, so he made the bear's paws white.

                    Then the bear went for the third time to the house-door, knocked at it and said,

                    "Open the door for me, children, your dear little mother has come home"

                    The little kids cried:

                    "First show us your paws so we know if you are mother."

                    Then he put his paws in through the window and they were white.
