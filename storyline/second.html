                    But the little kids knew that it was the bear, by the rough voice.

                    They also saw his big paws and his sharp teeth.

                    "We will not open the door," cried they, "you are not our mother. She has a soft, pleasant voice, but your voice is rough; you are the bear!

                    "Mother doesn't have 10 inch claws and sharp teeth" cried they, "leave us alone"
