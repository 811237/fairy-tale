        <h5>"Open the door, dear children; your mother is here, and has brought something back with her for each of you."</h5>
        <h5>But the little kids knew that it was the bear, by the rough voice.</h5>
        <h5>They also saw his big paws and his sharp teeth.</h5>
        <h5>"We will not open the door,"" cried they, "you are not our mother. She has a soft, pleasant voice, but your voice is rough; you are the bear!â€™</h5>
        <h5>"Mother doesn't have 10 inch claws and sharp teeth" cried they, "leave us alone"</h5>
