                    The Bear, tired and hungry comes back to the house as he is and tries to break down the door

                    But the little kids knew that he would come back so they were ready

                    As the bear ran towards the door to slam it open the little kids opened in and the bear ran past and got hit in the head

                    The first little kid yelled to attack, "lets get him" said the second kid

                    They end up jumping the bear and attcked him and hurt him so bad he'll never come back
