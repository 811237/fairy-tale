        <h5>The Bear, tired and hungry comes back to the house as he is and tries to break down the door</h5>
        <h5>But the little kids knew that he would come back so they were ready</h5>
        <h5>As the bear ran towards the door to slam it open the little kids opened in and the bear ran past and got hit in the head</h5>
        <h5>The first little kid yelled to attack, "lets get him" said the second kid</h5>
        <h5>They end up jumping the bear and attcked him and hurt him so bad he'll never come back</h5>
