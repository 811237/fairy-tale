                    <h5>Once upon a time there was an old goat.</h5> 
                    <h5>She had seven little kids, and loved them all, just as a mother loves her children.</h5>
                    <h5>One day she wanted to go into the woods to get some food.</h5>
                    <h5>So she called all seven to her and said,</h5> 
                    <h5>"Children dear, I am going into the woods. Be on your guard for the bear. 
                        If he gets in, he will eat up all of you all, even your skin and hair. The villain often disguises 
                        himself, but you will recognize him at once by his rough voice and his black feet."</h5>
                    <h5>The kids said, "Mother dear, we will take care of ourselves. You can go away without any worries."</h5>
                    <h5>Then the old one bleated, and went on her way with her mind at ease.</h5>
                    <h5>It was not long before someone knocked at the door and called out.</h5>
