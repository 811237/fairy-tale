                    The bear went away to a shopkeeper and bought himself a great big 
                    balloon filled with helium. The bear inhaled all the helium 
                    and made his voice soft with it. Then he came back, 
                    knocked at the door of the house, and called:
                    ‘Open the door, dear children, your mother is here and has brought 
                    something back with her for each of you.’

                    children saw them...
